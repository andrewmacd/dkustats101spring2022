# Planning 

## Describe the dataset

### Where did the data come from?

- Write down the 5 W's of this dataset

### What are the variables?

- Write down the variable type definition for the first five variables in the dataset (you can get more detail about the dataset by `summary(mcdonalds)`)

## Expectations

### Overall expectations

- You should develop a question based on some curiosity you have about the distribution of at least **two variables**. For example, what do you expect is the distribution of fat? Calories?     
  + Write down your question and the motivation for the question.
  + Remember to describe what you expect the distribution to be like in the terms of the textbook: shape, center, and spread
  
### Expectations for a specific category

- Now think about what the distribution of the same two variables might be for a specific menu item type and write down some expectations. 

# Investigation

## Distribution displays

### Histograms

- Make histograms of your **two** variables using `ggplot()` and `geom_histogram()`, make one for the entire menu, just for the menu item type you considered earlier, and one faceted by `Category` so you can see the distribution of each menu item category.
  + Hint 1: remember, to subset the data, you can use the `filter()` verb like the below code block.
  + Hint 2: make sure to replace `<your variable of interest>` and `<your category>` with the actual name of the variable you are investigating and the category of items you are considering! 
  + Hint 3: remember also, you will need to create a new code block. The above block is simply for text display, you will need to use the Insert Code Block button to make a new code block.
  
```
menu.subset <- mcdonalds %>%
  filter(Category = <your category>)

ggplot(menu.subset, aes(x=<your variable of interest>)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

- Interpret your histograms

### Box plots

- Make a box plot comparing the distribution of every menu item for your two chosen variables.
  + Hint 1: in the `aes()` section of the `ggplot()` call, specify `x=<your variable of interest>, y=Category`
  + Hint 2: to make a boxplot, use `geom_boxplot()`
  
- Interpret the box plots. 
  + What is interesting or notable about the distributions? 
  + What does the distribution look like for your chosen Category? 
  + Do you prefer this distribution view to the histograms? 
  + When would you use histograms and when would you use a graph like this?

### Transformations

- Could the distributions of your two chosen variables benefit from being re-expressed? Try a few re-expressions and see how it affects the shape of the distributions via viewing the histograms before and after reeexpression.
  + Hint: remember, you can use the `mutate()` verb in a piped command, such as: `mutate(logcals = log(Calories))` 

### Contingency table

- First, create a new variable via `mutate()` that is `yes` if the `Saturated.Fat` is greater than 10 (this is about the recommended amount per meal according to [here](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11208-fat-what-you-need-to-know)) and `no` otherwise

  + Hint: you can use a bit of code similar to the below to generate a contingency table:
  
```
mcdonalds.new <- mcdonalds %>%
  mutate(<new variable name>, ifelse(<logical condition>, 
                                     <if statement is true value>,  
                                     <if statement is false value>))
```

- Breaking this down,
  + `<new variable name>` is the name of the new variable you want to create
  + `<logical condition>` indicates a true/false statement (such as x>1)
  + `<if statement is true value>` specifies what value to assign the new variable if the logical statement is true
  + `<if statement is false value>` specifies what value to assign the new variable if the logical statement is false

- Create a contingency table (using the `kable(table(...))` commands) for your variable according to Category
  + What interesting or insightful findings can we develop from this contingency table?

# Concluding thoughts

Overall, summarize what you have learned about the distribution of your two variables and from the contingency table. 

# Extra

If you have time, complete the above steps with additional variables.
